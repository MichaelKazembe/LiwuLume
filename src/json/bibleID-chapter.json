And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses. <span data-number=\"12\" data-sid=\"EXO 1:12\" class=\"v\">12</span>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel. <span data-number=\"13\" data-sid=\"EXO 1:13\" class=\"v\">13</span>And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour: <span data-number=\"14\" data-sid=\"EXO 1:14\" class=\"v\">14</span>And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, <span class=\"add\">was</span> with rigour.</p><p class=\"p\"><span data-number=\"15\" data-sid=\"EXO 1:15\" class=\"v\">15</span>¶ And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one <span class=\"add\">was</span> Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: <span data-number=\"16\" data-sid=\"EXO 1:16\" class=\"v\">16</span>And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see <span class=\"add\">them</span> upon the stools; if it <span class=\"add\">be</span> a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it <span class=\"add\">be</span> a daughter, then she shall live. <span data-number=\"17\" data-sid=\"EXO 1:17\" class=\"v\">17</span>But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive. <span data-number=\"18\" data-sid=\"EXO 1:18\" class=\"v\">18</span>And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive? <span data-number=\"19\" data-sid=\"EXO 1:19\" class=\"v\">19</span>And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women <span class=\"add\">are</span> not as the Egyptian women; for they <span class=\"add\">are</span> lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them. <span data-number=\"20\" data-sid=\"EXO 1:20\" class=\"v\">20</span>Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty. <span data-number=\"21\" data-sid=\"EXO 1:21\" class=\"v\">21</span>And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses. <span data-number=\"22\" data-sid=\"EXO 1:22\" class=\"v\">22</span>And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.</p>",
