## Quick start (Vite)

This repo now contains a minimal Vite scaffold.

1. Install dependencies (this will add Vite):

```bash
npm install --save-dev vite
```

2. Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

4. Preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

If you prefer to add Vite and a framework template quickly, run one of the official create commands, for example:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```
